# OpenVoting
An open-source fair voting system built for communities

This app is heavily work-in-progress. Please check back later!

TODO:
- General UX tidy up and consistency
- Mobile support / responsive design
- Make title / description configurable per poll e.g. disable for logo contests
- Improve error handling
- Fix pages flashing when changing state especially if previous data is being shown
- Make sure entries are ordered by votes in history page
- Make sure entires are ordered randomly for each user during voting stage (including the blurred previews in submission stage)
- Blur the images much more during submission stage
- Ensure non admins cannot access admin-only data via API
- Cleanup logged out page UX
- Consistent spacing / padding throughout the app
- Fix grid view for vote entries
- Add Discord bot for a command to easy one-time login link without having to sign in via browser Discord (where people are often not logged in)
- Fill out README with overview, setup instructions, etc.
- Decide if this is gonna be exclusively designed for logos / art contests or more general voting use cases
- Add proper server-side unit tests
