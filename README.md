# OpenVoting
An open-source fair voting system built for communities

This app is heavily work-in-progress. Please check back later!

TODO:
- Show if you've voted yet clearly incl on list page
- Show voting instructions more clearly (select up to X entries etc)
- Voting details could all be under a dropdown to reduce clutter
- Adjustable slider for the size of the entries per row on the voting page
- Show total number of votes cast so far in the poll (but not specifics)
- Add Discord bot for a command to easy one-time login link without having to sign in via browser Discord (where people are often not logged in)
- Fill out README with overview, setup instructions, etc.
